# Music_Classification
This Repo was used for our 461P final project to design a music classification model that can predict the genre of songs from a 30 second sound clip extracted from within it.

The Final_Demo file contains an easy to run live demo which will allow you to specify any youtube link and time to take a sample from. Some songs don't work due to permissions but for the most part it works with any song.

The Test_Demo file contains our previous tests of youtube songs that work properly with the demo.

The Old Demo folder is the working directory where we tested and created the demos.
The Model Selection folder contains the notebooks where we ran feature selection, as well as created and identified the best models for supervised and unsupervised.
